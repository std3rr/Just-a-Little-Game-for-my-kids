# Just-a-Little-Game-for-my-kids
A little game written a weekend exploring pyglet game development.<br><br>
![screencap](screen_cap.gif)

One play around with this is download and install anaconda from:<br>
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
<br><br>
I use python3 for my projects.<br>
In anaconda go to Environments and chose Open Terminal from the little play button.
<br><br>
From terminal install some newer version of pyglet.
```
conda install -c darthhack pyglet
```
You can edit the files any way you like or through some Python IDE.
I personaly used Atom for this project:<br>
