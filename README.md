# Just-a-Little-Game-for-my-kids
A little game written a weekend exploring pyglet game development.<br><br>
![screencap](screen_cap.gif)

I use python3 for my projects.<br>
One play around with this is download and install **anaconda** from:<br>
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
<br><br>

From terminal you'll need to install some newer version of **pyglet**.<br>
In anaconda go to Environments and chose Open Terminal from the little play button.
<br>
```
conda install -c darthhack pyglet
```
You can edit the files any way you like or through some Python IDE.<br>
I personaly used **Atom** for this project:<br>
